# Spectal-imaging
I successfully downloaded and installed the Freelook viewer software to view ENVI spectral files. I also obtained the necessary spectral files, which consisted of "Colorchecker 121 ms", "Leaves (Specim IQ)\006 (Select 750 nm for the Red channel)", "Infrared (by sarita.keski-saari@uef.fi)", and "124 (rock painting)". The total size of the spectral files was several gigabytes.
Using the Freelook viewer, I opened the spectral images and loaded the preview in several different ways including gray-scale, RGB (using spectral bands RED 630 nm, Green 530 nm, Blue 430 nm), and RGB using other spectral bands (such as using IR channel of 800 nm instead of 630 nm for the "Leaves" image).
I also examined the spectra of different color-patches in the "Colorchecker" image and made the plastic leaves visible in the "Leaves (Specim IQ)" image as demonstrated in the lecture. I also played with the bands in the "Infrared" image to show the second image below the first on the top. Finally, I played with the spectral bands in the "124 (rock painting)" image to check if all bands were equal for visibility of the rock painting.
